# twiddler-configs

This repo holds my [Twiddler3](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/) keyboard
config file as well as cheat sheets for the Twiddler3 layouts out
listed below. Each is exemplified by the first block from their cheat
sheet. Hope the cheets are useful to someone!

## Default

This (exemplified by the first set from the cheat sheet) is the
default keyboard layout coming with the Twiddler since 20 years or so.
Its letters are ordered alphabetically which makes it pretty easy to
learn.

## TabSpace

This was made by Brandon Rhodes in 1999 and changes the default layout
in many ways, especially for optimizing the letter distribution and to
make it more useful for a programmer/terminal user. He discusses the
layout and its ideas at length 
[in this PDF](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/projects/tabspace-guide.pdf).

## BackSpice

User Alex Bravo started from TabSpace and made his own
modifications until the two shared little resemblance. You can get 
the latest backspice config and read more information 
[at his github reposity](https://github.com/AlexBravo/Twiddler).

## DelEnt

![delentimage](img/delent.png)

This is my personal keyboard layout, named after the Del and Ent keys
being next to each other in it (had to pick something...). I made this
by starting from the Default config (so *not* from TabSpace) and
changing the letter to match how commonly they appear in English; the
config then grew from there. 

While I'm both a Unix user and a programmer, my main use of the
Twiddler is for writing text when on the move (usually "blindly", with
the phone tucked away in a pocket). So this layout does not have much
focus on programming/terminal use like the TabSpace layout. I also
have rather short fingers which influenced where various common keys
ended up. It's a work in progress.

## Cheat-sheet template

![defaultimage](img/template.png)

I've made an SVG template for presenting your own Twiddler config in a
nicer way. All the cheat sheets were created with it. It's meant to
become a little folder you can fold once or twice for easy reference.

The template was created in the free program
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and is released under BSD so use
as you like. The PDFs I made are ISO A4 format. If you prefer another
format, you can always change the document type of the corresponding
SVGs in Inkscape and print that.
